I worked on a basic project to make a Fibonacci sequence. Here's what I did:
First, I created a standard Fibonacci sequence.
Then, I made a Fibonacci sequence based on the user's input number.
Lastly, I created a loop that kept asking the user for numbers they wanted to see in the sequence. The loop would only stop if the user entered '0'.
